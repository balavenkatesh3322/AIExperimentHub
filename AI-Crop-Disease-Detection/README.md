# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection  

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection** project! This tool uses advanced AI technology to identify potential diseases in crop images and recommend mitigation strategies. By leveraging **Google Gemini** and other generative models, the application can analyze crop health from images and provide actionable insights.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- **Image Upload**: Upload crop images in common formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG).  
- **Disease Detection**: The app processes the image to detect signs of diseases in the crop.  
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Based on the analysis, the app provides recommendations for mitigating the detected disease.  
- **Gemini Integration**: Utilizes the **Gemini-1.5 Flash Model** to generate disease insights from uploaded images.  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Upload an Image**: Upload a crop image showing potential signs of disease.  
2. **Process the Image**: The app processes the image and sends it to the Gemini model for analysis.  
3. **Receive Analysis**: The Gemini model analyzes the image and provides a disease diagnosis with mitigation strategies.
